Morse Code using a binary tree


"Morse code is a common code that is used to encode messages consisting of letters and digits. Each letter consists of a series of dots and dashes, for example, the code for the letter a is - and the code for the letter b is -. Store each letter of the alphabet in a node of a binary tree of depth 4. The root node is at depth 0 and stores no letter. The left node at depth 1 stores the letter e (code ) and the right node stores the letter t (code is -). The four nodes at depth 2 stores the letters with codes (,-, -, --). To build the tree read a file in which each line consists of a letter followed by its code. The letters should be ordered by tree depth. To find the position for a letter in the tree, scan the code and branch left for a dot and branch right for a dash. Encode a message by replacing each letter by its code symbol. Then decode the message using Morse code tree. Make sure you use a delimiter symbol between coded letters."
